# Calibration light scattering - cell diameter
The goal of this project is to use an optimized Mie theory to infer particle cell size from forward scatter measurements. In order to use Mie theory, an optimization method was developed to minimize the difference between forward scattering measured by SeaFlow and estimated using Mie theory. The optimization step was necessary because the optical geometry of the flow cytometer is not precisely known. An optimization procedure was conducted to scale the dimensionless values of forward scatter, in which the differences between the Mie-modeled and measurement-derived forward scatter were minimized. We used SeaFlow measurements of calibration particles of known refractive index and size. These particles includes 7 sizes of polystyrene beads (0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.83, 3.1 and 5.7 µm in diameter; n = 1.6003) (left panel).
Using this optimization, a lookup table of theory-based solutions for particle forward scattering was created over a range of particle diameter detectable by the SeaFlow (0.3 - 10 µm) and index of refraction applicable to marine phytoplankton (n=1.3785 +/- 0.014). To evaluate the applicability of these solutions, we compared Mie-predicted cell diameter to observations of 9 phytoplankton cultures using Coulter Counter (right panel).
